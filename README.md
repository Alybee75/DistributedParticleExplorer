## How to Run

- Run the requirements.sh script either by double clicking or typing sh requirements.sh in a gitbash terminal.
- Run the run_cmake.sh script file either by double clicking or typing sh run_cmake.sh in a gitbash terminal to compile and build the cpp program. Make sure to have cmake installed.
- Run the Server by opening the ParticleSimulationServer.JAR file in the main project folder. Or in command line interface 
on the project main folder, use the command java -jar ParticleExplorerServer.jar
- Run the Client by opening the ClientServer.exe file

*Notes: 
- Make sure to have the project in a directory that doesn't contain spaces as this could cause problems with the requirements.sh script.
- CMake or Visual Studio needs to be installed on the machine to prevent problems with the script files.

## How to Use
### Developer Mode in Java Server
- To add a single particle, ensure that the program is in developer mode, no checkbox is enabled, and the first four fields are all filled out.
